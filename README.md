# Action Creator for Nirvana

The 'Action Creator for Nirvana' addon for Firefox lets you add new actions to your inbox of Nirvana for GTDÂ® (https://nirvanahq.com) without opening the web-client.
Please notice: The addon is not affiliated with or created by Nirvana.

# Installation steps

* The first step is to download the addon in the official Firefox addon store. You can find it here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/action-creator-for-nirvana/
* After the installation was successful a new icon will appear in the addon bar of Firefox
* By clicking on the icon a settings page will open, where you can configure your inbox mail adress
** You can find this mail adress in the web client (https://focus.nirvanahq.com) under 'Settings' -> 'My Account' -> 'Creating Tasks via Email'

# How does the addon work?
* The next time you click on the icon in the addon bar a popup window will open where you can create your task
* Because the addon currently uses the possibility to create actions via mail, the affect on clicking the 'Create' button will open up a mailto-link. This means your favorized mail program will be opened. You just have to hit the send button there.
